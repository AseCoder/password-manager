# password-manager
 Electron app for managing passwords

 Only has support for Windows, tested only on Windows 10.

 I do not plan to continue development, add features or fix bugs.

 I understand that this app has mild security flaws.
 
 To start using it, run `npm install` and run it with `electron .`
